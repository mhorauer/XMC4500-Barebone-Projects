Since the standard windows command prompt has rather limited capabilities, I recommend to use the free http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/scriptcenter/dd742419.aspx[PowerShell]. Furhermore, add a right-click menu to the file explorer (see below).

[WARNING]
[red]#Beware of installation in paths using Spaces or other non-ASCII characters. Even the default dialogs may result in non-functional setups. Better install the tools in a directory like `C:\essd`.
Likewise, beware of virtual folders. Make all file-extensions visible. Add the folders to the programs to your `PATH` variable.#

== GNU Tools for ARM Embedded

Download the http://fhe.technikum-wien.at/~horauer/xmc/gcc-arm-none-eabi-4_8-2014q2-20140609-win32.exe[GNU Tools for ARM Embedded installer] and execute it. When asked to modify the +PATH+ variable let the installer do it.

== SEGGER J-Link

Download and install the respective http://www.segger.com/jlink-software.html[SEGGER J-Link software & documentation pack for Windows]

== Eclipse-CDT

Determine whether you are running a 32-bit or 64-bit copy of Windows via the _System Settings_.

First download and install the http://www.java.com/en/download/manual.jsp?locale-=en[JAVA JDK from Oracle].

Next, you'll need a `make.exe` utility. To that end, install either http://www.mingw.org/[MinGW] or http://www.codeblocks.org[CodeBlocks with MinGW]. Copy and rename the `mingw32-make.exe` program in the `MinGW\bin` folder to `make.exe`. Finally, modify the +PATH+ variable of your system to point to this location.

Download and install the respective http://eclipse.org/downloads/packages/eclipse-ide-cc-developers/keplersr2[Eclipse] version.

*Adding a Command Prompt to the "right-click" Menu of the File Explorer:* +

Edit the Windows Registry: Select `Start Menu` and enter `regedit.exe` - the registry editor shall be launched. Within the registry editor navigate to: `HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE` -> `Software` -> `Classes` -> `Folder` -> `shell`.
There, right-click and create a new key called `Command Prompt`. Within the newly created command prompt (select it and right-click) create a new key named `command` and set the value: Right-click (Default) and enter as Value Data:

....
cmd.exe /k pushd %1
....

image:w7_cmdprompt.png[width="320",link="w7_cmdprompt.png"] 

[NOTE]
Eventually, you may need to add `%SystemRoot%\system32\` before the cmd.exe if the executable can't be found.

Now, using the Windows file-explorer you can select a folder, right-click and select `Command Prompt` from the pop-up menu. This will launch a `cmd.exe` shell with a prompt in this directory.
