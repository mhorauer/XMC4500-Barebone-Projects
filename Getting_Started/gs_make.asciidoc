== Using a Makefile project

. Download and extract the source code: link:gs_make.zip[gs_make.zip]
. Open a terminal window (CMD) and change to the directory where you extracted the source code
+
....
$ ls
bin  Makefile  src
$ ls src
core_cm4.h  core_cmInstr.h  main.c  system_xmc4500.h  xmc4500-1024.ld  xmc4500.h
....


=== Build the Code

....
$ make
[...]
arm-none-eabi-size bin/main.elf
   text	   data	    bss	    dec	    hex	filename
    108	      0	      0	    108	     6c	bin/main.elf
....

This command built four files in the +bin+ folder.

....
$ ls bin
main.bin  main.elf  main.lst  main.map
....

=== Debug the Program

Connect the XMC Relax Kit (the debugger side) to your computer using a MicroUSB cable.

==============
[WARNING]
Using Microsoft Windows you'll need to start the JLinkGDBServer first, before entering the following commands. Select `USB`, specify the `XMC4500-1024` device from Infineon and select `SWD` as debug interface before clicking `OK`.

==============

....
$ make debug
[...]
(gdb) l 30
25	  PORT1->IOCR0 |= 0x8000; // P1.1 output, push pull   
26	
27	  while(1) {
28	    PORT1->OUT = 0x2; // write 1 to P1.1 -> Port1.1 is low
29	    wait(i);
30	    PORT1->OUT = 0x0; // write 0 to P1.1 -> Port 1.1 is high
31	    wait(i);
32	    i = i + 5000;
33	  }
34	}
(gdb) b 28
(gdb) b 30
(gdb) c

(gdb) p i
$1 = 105000
...
(gdb) q
....

TIP: Checkout the GDB commands section of the link:gs_cmd.html[Getting Started - CMD - Bare Bone] documentation.

=== Cleanup

To remove intermediate and generated files type:

....
$ make clean
....

=== Reuse

In order to reuse the +Makefile+ for a different project, simply keep the directory structure as is.
