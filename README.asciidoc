XMC4500-Barebone-Projects
=========================

This repositories hosts various bare-bone embedded systems projects for the XMC4500 Cortex-M4 microcontroller from Infineon technologies AG. The examples target the http://www.mikrocontroller.net/articles/XMC4500[Relax Kit] evaluation boards available from http://www.ehitex.de/[Hitex] or http://www.infineon.com/[Infineon].

Instead of using the DAVE toolchain, the examples hosted here are cross-platform (Windows, OSX, and Linux) and are developed using a

* plain Makefile approach or a
* standard Eclipse CDT with the GNU ARM plugin installed.

NOTE: Checkout the documentation in the folder setup on how to install the toolchain. 

== Getting Started

The folder Getting-Started hosts very fundamental getting started examples using

. the command-line
. a Makefile
. Eclipse-CDT

For either example a simple step-by-step description is available.

== IO Examples

== Timer Examples

== ADC/DAC Examples

== USIC Examples
